<h1>Hey, I'm Richard 👋</h1>

I'm a **Backend Software Engineer** based in Brazil, fluent in English, and currently studying **Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP**.  
I work mainly with **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Node.js**, and **TypeScript**, and I enjoy building clean, scalable systems with intention and good architecture.  
I’m into **clean code**, **hexagonal architecture**, **DDD**, and backend craftsmanship in general.  
Always learning, always building.
